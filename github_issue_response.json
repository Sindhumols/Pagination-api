Feature Description\r\n\r\nAllow exposing native mousedown and touchstart events to parent elements such  that listeners farther up the chain can respond before a CdkDragEvent has started. Without these events, certain gestures (swiper, etc) cannot be achieved when events are started on a DragRef element, as drag-drop effectively swallows them whether they are used or not.\r\n\r\nThis feature should be enabled only if desired using the `CDK_DRAG_CONFIG` InjectionToken / provider pattern.\r\n\r\n#### Use Case\r\n\r\nAllow propagation of events to parent components in the DOM.
